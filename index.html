        <h2>SERVICES</h2>
        <p> 
          Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary time needed to understand your product vision. 
          The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work. 
          Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces you need.
